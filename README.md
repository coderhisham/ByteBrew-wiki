# ☕ ByteBrew Tech Notes

Welcome to **ByteBrew**, a curated collection of technical notes brewed over time — one byte at a time.

This Obsidian vault serves as my personal knowledge base for software development, covering everything from systems architecture and DevOps to web development, debugging, and more. It's an evolving space where ideas are distilled, patterns are logged, and learnings are refined.

<!--
## 🗂 Structure

The vault is organized by topic, typically structured as:

```

📁 01. Web Development/
📁 02. Backend Systems/
📁 03. DevOps/
📁 04. Design Patterns/
📁 05. Debugging & Optimization/
📁 06. Architecture/
📁 07. Notes & Logs/

Each folder contains markdown notes, diagrams, checklists, and references.

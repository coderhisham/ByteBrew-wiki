# ☕ bytebrew.wiki

Welcome to **bytebrew.wiki** — a personal knowledge base where technical insights are steeped, distilled, and poured into Markdown.

This is where bytes turn into brews: concise, evolving notes on software engineering, development patterns, and things I wish I remembered sooner.

## 🧠 What is this?

A second brain for the builder's mind.

This wiki is built on Obsidian and versioned with Git. It exists to:

- Capture fleeting knowledge before it evaporates
- Sharpen understanding through writing
- Create a reusable mental toolkit
- Connect ideas across disciplines

## 🍵 Brew Philosophy

> _“Don’t just sip the coffee — understand how it’s brewed.”_

Every note here is a work-in-progress. Some are just seeds, others are steeped and refined. This isn’t a showcase — it’s a lab notebook, a memo pad, a garden of thoughts under continuous fermentation.
